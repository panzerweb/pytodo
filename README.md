## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pytodo.git
cd pytodo
```
---
# Virtual Environment (Recommended)
## Create and activate venv
```python
python -m venv venv
```
## On Windows:
```python
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

# Install Dependencies
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run the script
The `pytodo` directory is considered a module through using `__pycache__` as you can see in the directory, and every other folder that has code has the same `__pycache__` since they were used as a module.

To **run the script**, you activate it using:
```python
python -m pytodo.main
```
or
```python
python pytodo/main
```

---
# Setting up script for Windows Startup boot
## For Windows:

1. Locate the pytodo.bat file in the project root.

2. Press Win + R, type:
```bash
shell:startup
```

- and press **Enter**.

3. Copy pytodo.bat into the opened Startup folder.

4. Now, PyTodo will launch automatically on boot.
